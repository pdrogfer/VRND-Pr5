Project *Night at the Museum*, from term 2 of Udacity VRND.

## Introduction
Project OnSale is an android Cardboard VR app that showcases the possibilities VR brings to architecture and the real state sector. This scene is a tour through 5 stations that present different pieces of information. It is done so *inside* a virtual tour on a project house that is on sale, but not yet built. Stations include background audio, narration, and some interactive effects applied to the house.  

## Outcomes
Through the development of this project I learned a lot about the possibilities of VR applied to architecture, what tools are being used now and some trends that will make possible amazing things in the future. I also increased my ability to work both with Unity and Blender (where I modeled the house used in the project). I am especially proud of being able to create a new project from the ground and be responsible for all stages of development and design.

## Story of the process
**Statement of Purpose:** OnSale is a tour that presents in an informal way some information and techniques available to architecture in VR.
**Persona:** For this project I created a user persona named John. John is a 37 year old architect, owner of a small firm that is doing well, but is seeking to make a difference among the competition. Being a young architect, John is seeking to incorporate new technologies into the development and marketing processes. He has played some VR games in his nephew HTC Vive, and has requested a demo to a VR studio to study the possibilities.

**Sketch:**

This was my starting point, a virtual visit to a house where I would include the necessary information panels. I made a simple house in Blender to accomodate the tour. 

## User testing outcomes and iteration
I performed frequent iterations of user testing to build the project with the best settings as soon as possible. While the general feedback has been positive, the user helped me improve the experience and find bugs I hadn't noticed.

**Initial Test:**
1. How do you feel your 'size' in relation to the scene and the objects in it?
User: I feel my size is appropriate, in relation to the trees and the house. But the panels are too big, or too close.
2. How do you feel in the scene. Is the experience comfortable or uncomfortable? Anything else?
User: The transition between stations is too fast. Also, the text in the panels is not easy to read. And the house is too small. I added fixes for all of these.
3. Can you describe the mood of the scene?
User: I am in a quiet and nice location somewhere in the country, looking at a nice house in a sunny day. I feel a pleasant and positive atmosphere.

**Medium Test:**
I added step by step the buttons to control the sunlight variation, and the color of the walls. User suggested to make panel 2 transparent, so the light change is easier to see. Also, to reposition the user and the panel in some of the stations, to make it more comfortable.

**Final Test:** 
User suggested to add a button in the last panel to go directly to the beginning, instantly, so the user doesn't get the sensation of going through the walls. 

## Breakdown of final piece
![panel 1](https://github.com/pdrogfer/VRND-Pr5/blob/master/panel_1.png)
Panel 1 states the benefits of using VR since it causes a great impression on new users.

![panel 2](https://github.com/pdrogfer/VRND-Pr5/blob/master/panel_2.png)
In Panel 2 user can change the sunlight to see how the house looks on the different moments of the day.

![panel 3](https://github.com/pdrogfer/VRND-Pr5/blob/master/panel_3.png)
Panel 3 explains how VR provides a more immersive visualization since the user can enter and navigate the house.

![panel 4](https://github.com/pdrogfer/VRND-Pr5/blob/master/panel_4.png)
In Panel 4 users can experiment realtime customization changing the color of the walls.

![panel 5](https://github.com/pdrogfer/VRND-Pr5/blob/master/panel_5.png)
Panel 5 presents an example of future trend in VR for architecture: architects will be able to design house models from within the VR model itself

## Conclusion
This project has been very interesting and challenging. I learned a lot building this VR experience.
